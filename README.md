# Vertical and Horizontal Data Partitioning for Classifier Ensemble Learning
The general code of our published article (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-19738-4_10)


This code is homogenous ensemble of decision tree classifiers. it can be easily modified to any classifier type



STEPS to use this code

1) Extract zipfile.
2) All our datasets are included in the folder (dat).
3) **Run the main source file (code_DT_v1).
4) The results will be reported automatically in a named file (report.csv).
5) The Majority and Weighted majority functions for decision fusion, are included in (functions.R).
6) **Finally, you should run (analyze_report.R) to analyze the results from (report.csv).


**For any doubts or more information, you can contact us.
